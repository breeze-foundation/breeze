# BREEZE
Breeze is a social blockchain which is built as a fork of avalon with a core idea of developing decentralized social media. With 3 seconds block time, Breeze is built to handle large transaction volumes as per the needs of a social media platform. Instead of developing dapps on the blockchain, breeze will be dedicated to its own social media platform, beSocial. As per current needs of a blockchain, our developers have tried their best to develop complete chain with ability of scaling in future.

## Witnesses
Breeze is run by its witnesses who produces new blocks and ensure the smooth running of blockchain. As of this update, number of consensus witnesses for breeze blockchain are 5 which will increase in future as the network grows. 11% of every generated token is reserved for witness fees. 1% goes to current block producer and remaining equally to last 10 block producers. Every token holder can upvote for witnesses as there is no need to stake tokens for voting. Top votes witnesses are eligible for block producing.

## Development
Development of breeze has been carried out by open source developers who are very experienced in development of blockchain. We invite highly active and passionate developers to join breeze development team and be a part of emerging social media blockchain. For this we have setup DAF (developer appraisal fund) which will be used to compensate new developments on breeze and its social media platform. 3% of every generated token is reserved for development fund.

All the ongoing development is in dev branch

## Features
Breeze has no mining nor any ICO. It is tailored to be a pure proof of likes blockchain where every token is generated as a result of new like on the social media platform. 
Breeze is run by its foundation which will operate under DAO. We will make sure to make breeze blockchain purely decentralized with all of its actions and decisions made by proposals on DAO board.
Breeze token will be linked to other chains via wrapped token and bridges.

## Economy
Breeze token economy is super simple. It has been designed in a way that every contributing member of community get rewarded. Every generated token is distributed like this:
10% authors - 5% Curators - 5% Affiliate/Airdrop - 11% witnesses - 30% LP Mining - 25% Staking - 3% DAF (developer appraisal fund) - 1% Charity - 10% DAO
